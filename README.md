# Saleae-Logic-Api-with-QTcpSocket
Simple adoption from SaleaeSocketApi using QT networking libraries for communicating with Saleae logic analyzers over TCP/IP.

The saleaesocket.h & saleaesocket.cpp files are based on the documentation found at https://github.com/saleae/SaleaeSocketApi. This reference is for C# based applications which is simply translated here for C++ applications with a <QTcpSocket> dependency.
